# Name-and-address-book-management
Assignment 05-07 P05

  The following information may be stored in a name and address book:
    -Person: <personID>, <name>, <phone number>, <address>
    -Activity: <activityID>, <personIDs>, <date>, <time>, <description>
  Create an application which allows the user to:
    1. Manage the list of persons and activities. The application must allow the user to add, remove,
  update, and list both persons and activities.
    2. Add/remove activities. Each activity can be performed together with one or several other
  persons, who are already in the userâ€™s address book. Activities must not overlap (not have the
  same starting date/time).
    3. Search for persons or activities. Persons can be searched for using name or phone number.
    Activities can be searched for using date/time or description. The search must work using
  case-insensitive, partial string matching, and must return all matching items.
    4. Create statistics:
      o Activities for a given day/week. List the activities for a given day, in the order of their
    start time, or their date/time.
      o Busiest days. This will provide the list of upcoming days with activities, sorted in
    descending order of the number of activities in each day.
      o Activities with a given person. List all upcoming activities to which a given person will
    participate.
      o List all persons in the address book, sorted in descending order of the number of
    upcoming activities to which they will participate.
    5. Unlimited undo/redo functionality. Each step will undo/redo the previous operation
  performed by the user. Undo/redo operations must cascade and have a memory-efficient
  implementation (no superfluous list copying).
